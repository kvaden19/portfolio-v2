          <p>I'm a software developer with a background in engineering and data analytics. I recently finished a certificate in full stack development from Rutgers University, adding JavaScript and the MERN Stack to my existing knowledge of SQL and Python.</p> 

          <p>The title of “software developer” may be a new one, but my dedication to logical problem-solving is not. I'm a mechanical engineer by background and spent the first few years of my career doing data analysis for energy efficiency projects. Most of my work has been done in small start-up or consulting environments, forcing me to adapt, learn new skill sets, and take on different roles. </p>

          <p>I taught myself SQL to streamline data-gathering tasks for my engineering team. I contributed to building an energy efficiency recommendations engine in Python. [think of a third thing; could be more product-y]</p>

          <p>Along the way I’ve collaborated with blah blah, and blah, navigated a thing, and managed a $XX million dollar project. I may be an early career software developer but I’m a mid-career soft skills person [finesse]</p>

          <p>As I took on and succeeded with these technical challenges I realized how much I enjoyed the process of putting a programming solution together to solve a problem. In January 2021 I made the decision to pivot to software development full time and enrolled in a web development bootcamp.</p>

          <p>As a full-stack or back-end developer, I’m excited to [do a really cool thing].</p>
